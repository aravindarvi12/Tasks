Window Object

The Window object is a global object in client-side JavaScript, representing the browser window containing a DOM document and acting as the root of the document object model.

The window object, supported by all browsers, represents the browser’s window and automatically includes global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables as members.

The Window object is responsible for managing global variables, functions, and objects, providing methods for browser interaction and managing properties related to frames, tabs, or windows, such as alert(), confirm(), setTimeout(), and setInterval().


Document Object

The Document object is the HTML document that appears in the browser window and serves as an interface for interacting with the web page’s content. The browser generates a Document Object Model of a web page upon loading it.

The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform-neutral interface that enables dynamic access and updating of a document’s content, structure, and style by programs and scripts.



Understanding the differences between Window and Document objects is crucial in JavaScript and web development. Window manages browser interactions, while Document acts as an interface for content manipulation. Using these functionalities allows developers to create interactive web experiences.
